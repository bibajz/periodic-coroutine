# periodic_coroutine
Schedule a coroutine to run periodically.

##  Usage
Let's say you want to call `your_coro` coroutine every 2 seconds, starting 5 seconds from now.
```python
from periodic_coroutine import Periodic

async def your_coro(*your_args, **your_kwargs):
    ...

your_periodic = Periodic(
    your_coro,
    2,
    *your_args,
    **your_kwargs
)

your_periodic.start(5)
```

To stop it (let's say 3 seconds from now), use
```python
your_periodic.stop(3)
```

## TODO
Improve the exception handling of provided coroutine. For now, the only thing that is covered (by providing
`ignore_exceptions=True` in the `Periodic` constructor) is when coroutine takes more time to complete than the
`interval`.

To have a truly robust handling, a design overhaul is needed. Probably encapsulate the handling logic, along with coroutine
and its args in a separate class (`HandledCoroutine`?). That would also allow for some state managment by the coroutine...

We will see.
